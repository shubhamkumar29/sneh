                            We provide preventive home healthcare services for the elderly.  It is our endeavour to bring focus on elder care in India through regular health management services supported by world class practices and systems. We do not believe that every senior citizen requires same preventive healthcare package. We analyse elderly peoples’ healthcare requirement through a detailed check-up before recommending an annual package. We also have a number of ancillary services to cater to the needs of elderly.

                            We realise that in today’s busy world preventive healthcare services for the entire family in the confines of the house are critical. While health awareness is increasing, time is a major constraint for people to take their entire family for regular health check-ups. Sneh home healthcare services can be trusted to take care of family health proactively. We understand the age group, size of the family, health history and other details before creating annual healthcare packages specific to a family. We don’t only conduct a thorough check-up but also analyse the reports and suggest future course of action.

                            A healthy and happy workforce is mandatory for a corporate to function well. Hence the need for preventive healthcare services focused on the health of the corporate executives. We do not serve you a ready Corporate Package, do a few lab tests, and present reports that make no sense.  Based on the profile of the company, the industry it is in and the employees’ profile, we custom make the perfect package. For us health is about analysing your reports and providing solution – not just testing.

                            In addition to preventive healthcare services, people might also need other medical and ancillary services to help them look after their health well. Keeping that in mind, SNeH Eldercare provides ancillary services in association with its trustworthy partners. Some of the ancillary services provided by us are Nursing Services, Care Givers, Supply and Setting of Medical Equipment, Rehabilitative care and more.
