                                    	Geriatrics is a subspeciality of medicine that focuses on health care of elderly people. It aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults. In our country 65 and above form the geriatric population but some consider 60 and above to be geriatric population.

                                    	Common geriatric problems are the major categories of impairment that appear in elderly people. These include immobility, instability, incontinence, urinary infections, depression and impaired intellect/memory etc. <br /><br />

										Impaired vision and hearing loss are common chronic problems among older people. These problems make elders feel isolated, disrupt their daily living and impact their confidence, which in turn leads to several other health complications.

                                        You can upgrade from a smaller package to a bigger one by paying the additional amount. However, if you want to move to a smaller package, you would have to wait for the tenure of your existing package to get over.

                                    <div>

                                        We do not believe in blindly selling a package, without understanding a person’s requirements. As each senior citizen’s health condition and requirements are different from the other, it is important to understand them well. A complete medical check-up in the first instance helps us to better understand a senior citizen’s healthcare needs. Based on that, we can offer preventive healthcare packages and recommend ancillary services.

                                        The senior citizens find it tiring to go to diagnostic centres for their tests and check-ups. In addition to that they have to wait in a queue to meet the doctor before and after their tests. We at SNeH Eldercare understand this perfectly well, and hence all the tests in the initial check-up are conducted at home itself. The doctors who are experts in eldercare come for home visits, explain all the findings completely and recommend further course of action.

                                        In the initial-check up all the tests are done at home. Even in annual packages most of the tests are done at home. Only in a case, where the machine required for the test cannot be brought home, does the senior citizen require to go to a diagnostic centre.

In case any of these reports indicate an issue, you would need to repeat that specific test. If there are some tests that have not been conducted, you would have to go through those tests. However, if you do not need to go through any tests, you would have to only pay Rs XXX, the consulting fee for our visiting doctor.

                                        SNeH is about preventive healthcare delivered with care, concern and affection.
