SNeH Eldercare is about preventive home healthcare services provided to geriatric (elderly) population of India with compassion, excellence and confidentiality. We offer preventive home healthcare packages and services to senior citizens, as well as people in the age group of 50 to 60 who suffer from geriatric problems.</p>

<p class="fontSize14 line20 openSansLight marginB20">
We are not in the business of selling preventive healthcare packages for senior citizens without understanding and analysing their health and requirements.
Our <a href="services">Initial Clinical Evaluation Package </a>(Priced at just Rs 1999*) enables us to understand your health better.  Our scope of work is way beyond just conducting a few tests and handing over the reports. As a preventive healthcare organisation for elders, we consider it our responsibility to analyse and explain these reports to elders as well as their designated family members. We also discuss the future course of action and make necessary recommendations.
It is only after the initial check-up that an <a href="services">Annual Package</a> is designed to fit your needs. Buy our <a href="services">Initial Clinical Evaluation Package</a> for Rs 1999 only.</a></p>

<p class="fontSize14 line20 openSansLight marginB20">
Though we have a few ready packages, in most cases we recommend a <a href="#">Custom or Disease Specific Package</a>. 

SNeH Eldercare has a panel of <a href="our-doctors">doctors</a> who are experts in geriatrics and eldercare. These doctors do home visits and health check-ups. In addition, we have a panel of consulting doctors. However, it is not necessary that you visit a consultant recommended by us.  </p>

<p class="fontSize14 line20 openSansLight marginB20">We also offer a number of <a href="ancillary-services">Ancillary Services</a> through our partners. These services include nursing services, delivering and setting up medical equipment, care givers, medicine delivery at home and more.
